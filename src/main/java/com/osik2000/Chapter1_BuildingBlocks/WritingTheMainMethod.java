    * We arrive at the main() method’s parameter list, represented as an array of

    * 1. String[] args
    * 2. String options[]
    * 3. String... friends

    * Optional Modifiers in main() Methods
    * While most modifiers, such as public and static, are required for main() methods,
    * there are some optional modifiers allowed.
    * public final static void main(final String[] args) {}
    * In this example, both final modifiers are optional, and the main() method is a valid
    * entry point with or without them.

    /*
    * Passing Parameters to a Java Program
    * The main() method’s parameter list is the only way to pass parameters to a Java program.
    * To run it, type this in the command line:
      javac WritingTheMainMethod.java
      java WritingTheMainMethod Bronx Zoo
    * The output is what you might expect:
      Hello World
      Bronx
      Zoo

    /*
    * Single-File Source-Code
    * If you get tired of typing both javac and java every time you want to try a code example,
    * there’s a shortcut. You can instead run
      java WritingTheMainMethod.java Bronx Zoo
    * There is a key difference here. When compiling first, you omitted the .java extension
    * when running java. When skipping the explicit compilation step, you include this
    * extension. This feature is called launching single-file source-code programs and is useful for
    * testing or for small programs. The name cleverly tells you that it is designed for when your
    * program is one file.
