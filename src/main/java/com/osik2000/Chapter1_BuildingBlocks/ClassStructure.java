// Most of the time, each Java class is defined in its own .java file. In this chapter,
// the only toplevel type is a class. A top-level type is a data structure that can be defined independently
// within a source file. For the majority of the book, we work with classes as the top-level type,
// but in Chapter 7, “Beyond Classes,” we present other top-level types, as well as nested types.
// A top-level class is often public, which means any code can call it. Interestingly, Java does
// not require that the type be public.
